# The Tom Waits Fansite
## Miletone 1 Project by Richard Martin
### The site has been designed as a place where Tom Waits fans can enjoy the latest news and watch, or listen to, recordings. It is designed for those who are familiar with his work or those who have never come across him before
## User Experience (UX)
### - First Time Visitor Goals
- The aim of the site is for users who have not encountered Tom Waits before, to get a clearly mapped out experience that would enable them to easily navigate between pages and to be able to intuitively visit the review sections and to watch video recordings. With a great user experience I would hope that people would then fill out the subscribe form which would enable them to keep updated on the news feed. If they didn't it may be that they don't like Tom Waits, rather than my website!

## Testing

- At the start of the project I encountered a lot of issues with GitPod and GitHub. I was unable to Git Push and I had also made some mistakes in the terminal when putting in commands. I found that by revisiting the training moduels that I was able to get a better understanding of some of the bugs that sometimes occured and how to best use the command line.
