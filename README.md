# The Tom Waits Fansite

## Miletone 1 Project by Richard Martin

### The site has been designed as a place where Tom Waits fans can enjoy the latest news and watch, or listen to, recordings. It is designed for those who are familiar with his work or those who have never come across him before

## User Experience (UX)

### - First Time Visitor Goals

- The aim of the site is for users who have not encountered Tom Waits before, to get a clearly mapped out experience that would enable them to easily navigate between pages and to be able to intuitively visit the review sections and to watch video recordings.

-  With a great user experience I would hope that people would then fill out the subscribe form which would enable them to keep updated on the news feed. If they didn't it may be that they don't like Tom Waits, rather than my website!

### - Returning and Frequent Visitor Goals

- I would like returning visitors and frequent users be able to input ideas on the comments section of the subscribe page. It may take the eventual form of a forum and would give users the opportunity of sharing their own news of any forthcoming events or releases.

- I would like to share the opportuntiy for contributors to create a newsletter to be shared with subscribers on a quarterly basis.

### -Design

#### - Colour Scheme

- Backgrounds are Antique White with Light Slate Gray for the navbar and footer sections. I have gone with these colours as I wanted a grainy feel to the site and have paired that with a black and white hero shot on the Home page.
 
#### - Typography

-  Black fonts are throughout and the font family is : 'Noticia Text', serif; 'Zen Old Mincho', serif;which have been taken from Google fonts. 

#### - Imagery

- There are a number of very striking shots available for Tom Waits but not all of them were of a suitable size or resolution. Choosing the B & W shot of him for the hero image on the Home Page, represented what I wanted the site to be about and reflected his music quite well.

### - Wireframes

-Home Page Wireframe-https://balsamiq.cloud/svzhrv4/p2qylhv/rAB27

-Mobile Wireframe-https://balsamiq.cloud/svzhrv4/p2qylhv/r2278

-Subscribe Wireframe- https://balsamiq.cloud/svzhrv4/p2qylhv/r9311

## Features

- Interactive elements where you can view album covers close up and click to watch YouTube videos of old recordings.
- Responsive. I have had issues with that element of the site but hope to get all pages resolved shortly.

## Technologies Used

### Languages Used

- HTML5 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML
- CSS3 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS

### Frameworks, Libraries and Programs Used

-Google Fonts | https://fonts.google.com/ which enabled me to import the chosen fonts for the project.

-Font Awesome | https://fontawesome.com/ which allowed me to import the social media icons for links in the footer.

-Git Hub | https://github.com/ This is the site that is used for storing projects that are commited and pushed from Git Pod.

-Git Pod | The program that the README.md file is being written in as well as all of the HTML5 and CSS3 files. 

-Balsamiq | https://balsamiq.com/ This site enables you to create Wireframes at the point of inception and you can share projects based on different price plans. This therefore allows collaborative working in the design process.

## Testing

- At the start of the project I encountered a lot of issues with GitPod and GitHub. I was unable to Git Push and I had also made some mistakes in the terminal when putting in commands. I found that by revisiting the training modules that I was able to get a better understanding of some of the bugs that sometimes occured and how to best use the command line.

- To test each HTML5 file I used https://validator.w3.org/ which provided me with where errors occured and helped me to pinpoint correcting them.

- To test each CSS3 file I used https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ which provided me with where errors occured and helped me to pinpoint correcting them.



### Testing From User Experience (UX) Section


### Further Testing


### Known Bugs

- There have been issues with getting the HTML files to load the CSS and I have checked the file path names on numerous attempts. All files have been validated through the W3C Validation Service.

- There are issues with the responsive of the design which still requires further work as of 25/10/2021.

## Deployment


### GitHub Pages

- Here you can find the project repo. https://github.com/Ramcod/Milestone1_Tom_Waits_Fansite 

### Forking the GitHub Repository

- "A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea. You can fork a repository to create a copy of the repository and make changes without affecting the upstream repository. 

- You can propose changes to someone else's project.
For example, you can use forks to propose changes related to fixing a bug. Rather than logging an issue for a bug you've found, you can:
  
  * Fork the repository.
  * Make the fix.
  * Submit a pull request to the project owner."


### Making a Local Clone

- To make a clone on your PC, in case of any issues online, you can follow this set of instructions that guides you visually through the process.
