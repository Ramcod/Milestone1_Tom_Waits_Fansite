		<div class="desc">This masterpiece from 1976 is considered a real fan favourite. It has the feel of a 40's detective film
			noir, but set in the gutter. This is downtrodden Tom, working shifts so that he might be able to afford a whiskey, and
			perhaps a night out with his lady. Top tracks include 'Step Right Up', 'Tom Traubert's Blues' and 'The Piano Has Been
			Drinking (Not Me)'.<hr></div>
      <div><em>"The milieu is familiar, but he makes it all sound fantastical. “The Piano Has Been Drinking (Not Me)” is another song that sounds like it was recorded at 3 a.m. in a bar, but what sets it apart is how Waits presents the setting as nearly surreal: “The piano has been drinking, my necktie is asleep,” he observes from his bench. “The telephone’s out of cigarettes, and the balcony is on the make.” It sounds like the world he has carefully crafted on his first three albums is unraveling at its seams. “Pasties and a G-String” de-eroticizes its low-rent burlesque as a phantasmagoria of despair and boredom. Even “Step Right Up,” with Waits playing the carnival barker on some seedy midway, turns advertising slogans into dark magic."</em>

  <div class="desc">Released in 1985 this is part of a 3 album release, that saw Tom reach cult status. The sounds on this are quite unique and sees Tom combine polka, with New Orleans brass bands, and good old rock 'n' roll working alongside Keith Richards. It also sees Tom experiment with industrial sounds and some of the album highlights include, 'Big Black Mariah', 'Time', and 'Gun Street Girl'. <hr></div>
  <div><em>"One of Rain Dogs’ most lasting achievements is its sonic experimentation. Tom Waits surrounded himself with like-minded musicians from the underground, avant-garde music scene in New York. They were after creating music that fell within the conventions of rock/pop music, but sounded nothing like typical rock/pop songs. Waits talked about that aspect of the album: “If I want a sound, I usually feel better if I’ve chased it and killed it, skinned it and cooked it. Most things you can get with a button nowadays. So if I was trying for a certain drum sound, my engineer would say: ‘Oh, for Christ’s sake, why are we wasting our time? Let’s just hit this little cup with a stick here, sample something, take a drum sound from another record and make it bigger in the mix, don’t worry about it.’ I’d say, ‘No, I would rather go in the bathroom and hit the door with a piece of two-by-four very hard.”"</em>

  <div class="desc">A real hit on the senses with this visual 'live' recording. Tom is fine form, with his live band, and this is no ordinary concert movie. Only ever released on VHS, copies are as rare as hen's teeth but you can catch excerpts on the 'Tom Live' page.The first time I saw this I wasn't sure if I was half asleep, as was like watching the weirdest dream you've had but with incredible music.<hr></div>
  
  <div><em>"Tom Waits: I think the question I get asked the most is, well I dunno know, it happens a lot, enough that I would remark on it - a lot of people come up to me and they say "Is it possible for a woman to get pregnant without intercourse?" My answer's always the same, I say: "Listen. We're gonna have to go all the way back to the civil war."<hr>"Combining performance footage of Tom Waits and his band with dramatic set pieces, this unique concert film showcases Waits' many talents. Waits plays a number of different characters in short vignettes, such as a ticket taker and a lighting operator. These scenes also incorporate Waits performing songs, which are taken mostly from his "Frank" albums. As the film moves across different areas of the theater, Waits also performs a series of monologues, demonstrating adept showmanship.”</em>

  </a>
  <div class="desc">Perhaps Tom's finest work and the number 1 choice of many fans. Released in 1999 and with some old collaborators including Smokey Hormel and Marc Ribot, there is a real diversity to the album. Highlights include the beautiful 'House Where Nobody Lives' and the eccentric 'Chocolate Jesus'.<hr></div>
  <div><em>"What Tom Waits does to the blues is something like what newspapers do to bright colors — in the way that a picture of the Sistine Chapel’s ceiling ends up looking like roast beef in the morning edition, Waits’ arty, seasick imagination turns a rural American song form into a garish, surreal fantasy.Bizarre humor aside, Mule Variations is also full of ballads -- wizened, aged, with a patina Waits songs lacked before. “Take It With Me” and “Picture in a Frame” contain a wealth of sentimental detail, set to an ocean of creaky, decaying piano notes. “Georgia Lee” is a devastating reaction to a real-life young girl who was found slain in Petaluma, California.It all adds up to his richest, most well-rounded listen. Whether you prefer your Waits poignant, prickly or impossibly strange, there are Variations here for you. Here’s a track-by-track retrospective of the album."</em>

  </a>
  <div class="desc">After a break of around 7 years, this album shows Tom's full palette and has a list of some of Tom's favourite collaboraters, including Keith Richards. This has been the last studio album and Tom has been focussing on acting roles including the brilliant 'Ballad of Buster Scruggs'<hr></div>
  <div><em>"For all the excellent clowning around, Bad As Me is, chiefly, an album full of compassion, anger and sorrow – the stuff that puts Waits on the same page as upstanding Bruce Springsteen and the emotional surgeon Leonard Cohen, as well as bad old Nick Cave and professional drunks the Pogues. "Pay Me" tells the story of an exile with a woozy weep that sounds both sentimentally Irish and quintessentially French. "They pay me not to come home," Waits rasps stoically. There are compromised men hitting the road here, failed relationships starting again (in "Chicago"), and lovers trying to rekindle their spark. The terrific "Kiss Me" is all vinyl hiss and jazzy antiquity, with Waits doing his gruffest bluesman growl. The warmongers and bankers get it in the neck so hard, you can't help but punch the air. "Talking at the Same Time" rues the downward turn of the economy with restrained elegance, while "Hell Broke Luce" is a lot angrier – a Waits-own rap set to left-right marching and machine gunfire. Indeed, Bad As Me's 13 tracks fairly rip along, alerting a new generation that there are few as fine as Waits."</em>

  </a>
  <div class="desc">Released in 1992, this album features one of Tom's biggest commercial hits with 'I Don't Wanna Grow Up'.This was about the time that I tried to introduce Tom to my friends, and I'm still trying 30 years later. There are lots of albums to choose from with a style for most people, so have a listen.<hr><em></div>
  <div>"Simply put, Bone Machine is not for the faint of heart. Even by Waits‘ standards, it’s a difficult listen, with its lyrical fixation on the macabre and its unhinged sonic palette. Yet because of this, it’s one that many see as Waits’ most fully realized work, one that if you as the listener overcome the challenge of confronting the album and in the process absorb all it has to offer, you come out the other side all the more grateful for having made the journey."<hr>"Bone Machine is dark, sad, furious, frightening and beautiful; a masterpiece of experimental rock. It may not be his magnum opus (I feel any aspiring music critic needs to use that term at one point or another), an accolade that probably goes to Rain Dogs, but it certainly would have been for most artists. It remains one of his darkest and most interesting albums."<em></div>
