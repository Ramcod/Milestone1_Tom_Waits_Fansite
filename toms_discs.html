		<div class="desc">This masterpiece from 1976 is considered a real fan favourite. It has the feel of a 40's detective film
			noir, but set in the gutter. This is downtrodden Tom, working shifts so that he might be able to afford a whiskey, and
			perhaps a night out with his lady. Top tracks include 'Step Right Up', 'Tom Traubert's Blues' and 'The Piano Has Been
			Drinking (Not Me)'</div>

  <div class="desc">Released in 1985 this is part of a 3 album release, that saw Tom reach cult status. The sounds on this are quite unique and sees Tom combine polka, with New Orleans brass bands, and good old rock 'n' roll working alongside Keith Richards. It also sees tom experiment with industrial sounds and some of the album highlights include, 'Big Black Mariah', 'Time', and 'Gun Street Girl'.</div>

  <div class="desc">A real hit on the senses with this visual 'live' recording. Tom is fine form, with his live band, and this is no ordinary concert movie. Only ever released on VHS, copies are as rare as hen's teeth but you can catch excerpts on the 'Tom Live' page.<br><hr><em>"Tom Waits: I think the question I get asked the most is, well I dunno know, it happens a lot, enough that I would remark on it - a lot of people come up to me and they say "Is it possible for a woman to get pregnant without intercourse?" My answer's always the same, I say: "Listen. We're gonna have to go all the way back to the civil war."<em></div>

<div class="albums">
  <div class="desc">Perhaps Tom's finest work and the number 1 choice of many fans. Released in 1999 and with some old collaborators including Smokey Hormel and Marc Ribot, there is a real diversity to the album. Highlights include the beautiful 'House Where Nobody Lives' and the eccentric 'Chocolate Jesus'.<br><em><hr>"What Tom Waits does to the blues is something like what newspapers do to bright colors — in the way that a picture of the Sistine Chapel’s ceiling ends up looking like roast beef in the morning edition, Waits’ arty, seasick imagination turns a rural American song form into a garish, surreal fantasy."</em>

  <div class="desc">After a break of around 7 years, this album shows Tom's full palette and has a list of some of Tom's favourite collaboraters, including Keith Richards.<br><hr>
  <em>"Bad as Me is as essential-- and as essentially weird-- as anything he's done before.
Bad as Me comprises mostly love songs: paeans to lasting love, the kind that changes and bends. Even when Waits is yearning for freedom, as he does on the drunk and twitchy "Get Lost", he still wants his longtime girl by his side."</em></div>

<div class="albums">
  <div class="desc">Released in 1992, this album features one of Tom's biggest commercial hits with 'I don't wanna grow up'.<br><hr><em>"Simply put, Bone Machine is not for the faint of heart. Even by Waits‘ standards, it’s a difficult listen, with its lyrical fixation on the macabre and its unhinged sonic palette. Yet because of this, it’s one that many see as Waits’ most fully realized work, one that if you as the listener overcome the challenge of confronting the album and in the process absorb all it has to offer, you come out the other side all the more grateful for having made the journey."<em></div>
